# Aylien Datascience Demos

This is a multi-page streamlit app containing demo apps built on top of the Aylien NewsAPI.

This project is intended for data scientists using the Aylien NewsAPI, but also for anyone interested in analyzing news data, 
or in making cool demos ;-).

For each of these demos, we provide a sample dataset that will allow them to run without a NewsAPI key. If you have a NewsAPI key
or a RADAR account, you can dynamically update the demos with new feed data.

## NewsAPI patterns
We also include some patterns that we re-use and modify regularly, such as a simple interface to the 

## Datascience Quickstarter Project
Also check out our open source bootstrapper for projects and demos: [datascience-project-quickstarter](https://github.com/AYLIEN/datascience-project-quickstarter)


### Models

Some demos show example workflows that are possible with off-the-shelf models from various places. 
But note that the internal models we build and train at Aylien are probably better than these ;-)
